My first GitHub project, a Discord bot that will give the user some permissions (and thus access to certain channels) by matching to a JSON file "units.json" that has been included. 

Create JSON file, "config.json" of the format below:

{
  "token" : "",
  "ownerID" : "",
  "game" : ""
}

Then run "Bot.java"
